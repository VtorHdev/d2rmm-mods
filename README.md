Mods for D2RMM

D2RMM is a Mod Manager for D2R that allows multiple mods to be installed together without conflicting. It does this by specifying a new mod format where each mod specifies how a file should change instead of providing a new version of that file.

You can find the Mod Manager in https://github.com/olegbl/d2rmm or https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/169
